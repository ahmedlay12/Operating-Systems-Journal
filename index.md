# CMPN202 – Operating Systems Technical Journal

**Programme:** BSc Cyber Security  
**Module Code:** CMPN202  
**Module Title:** Operating Systems  

This GitHub Pages site documents my technical journal for the CMPN202 Operating Systems coursework.  
It presents a structured, week-by-week record of my work configuring, securing, monitoring, and evaluating a headless Linux server administered remotely via SSH.

The journal demonstrates progressive learning across all seven weeks, including system planning, security hardening, performance evaluation, scripting, and critical reflection in line with the module learning outcomes (LO3, LO4, LO5).

## Coursework Overview

The coursework involves deploying a headless Linux server within a VirtualBox environment and administering it exclusively via the command line from a separate workstation system.  
Industry-standard security controls, monitoring techniques, and performance testing methodologies are implemented and evaluated.

All configuration tasks are performed using CLI tools, with evidence captured through terminal output, configuration files, scripts, and screenshots.
